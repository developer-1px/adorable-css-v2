# State Management

AdorableCSS makes it incredibly easy to style elements based on their interactive state, such as when they are hovered, focused, or disabled. You can apply styles conditionally by adding a state prefix to any utility class.

## Basic State Prefixes

To apply a utility on a specific state, add a prefix like `hover:`, `focus:`, or `active:`.

```html
<button
  class="
  bg(blue-500) c(white) p(3/6) r(md) transition
  hover:bg(blue-600) hover:shadow(lg)
  active:bg(blue-700) active:scale(0.98)
  disabled:bg(gray-300) disabled:pointer(not-allowed)
"
>
  Click Me
</button>
```

In this example:

- **`hover:`**: When the button is hovered, its background color darkens and a shadow appears.
- **`active:`**: When the button is clicked, it gets even darker and slightly smaller.
- **`disabled:`**: If the button has the `disabled` attribute, it will have a gray background and a "not-allowed" cursor.

## Group States

Sometimes you want to change the style of a child element when its parent is in a certain state. This is common for custom dropdowns, cards with interactive elements, and more.

For this, AdorableCSS uses the `group` and `group-*` pattern:

1.  Add the `group` class to the parent element.
2.  Use a `group-hover:`, `group-focus:`, etc. prefix on the child element.

```html
<div
  class="group r(lg) bg(white) p(6) border(2/transparent) hover:border(blue-500)"
>
  <h3 class="font(lg) bold c(gray-800) group-hover:c(blue-500)">Card Title</h3>
  <p class="c(gray-600) group-hover:c(gray-700)">
    This paragraph will change color when the whole card is hovered.
  </p>
</div>
```

**Breakdown:**

- The parent `div` has the `group` class.
- When the parent `div` is hovered (`hover:border(blue-500)`), the `h3` and `p` tags inside it change color because they use the `group-hover:` prefix.

## Available State Prefixes

Here is a list of the available state and group-state prefixes:

| State           | Group Version         | Description                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `hover:`        | `group-hover:`        | When the element is hovered with a mouse.            |
| `focus:`        | `group-focus:`        | When the element has focus.                          |
| `focus-within:` | `group-focus-within:` | When the element or a descendant has focus.          |
| `active:`       | `group-active:`       | When the element is being activated (e.g., clicked). |
| `disabled:`     | `group-disabled:`     | When the element is disabled.                        |
| `checked:`      | `group-checked:`      | For checkboxes and radio buttons in a checked state. |
| `selected:`     | `group-selected:`     | For selected options in a `<select>` element.        |
| `first:`        | `group-first:`        | The first child of its parent.                       |
| `last:`         | `group-last:`         | The last child of its parent.                        |
| `odd:`          | `group-odd:`          | An odd-numbered child of its parent.                 |
| `even:`         | `group-even:`         | An even-numbered child of its parent.                |

## Combining with Responsive Prefixes

You can easily combine state prefixes with responsive prefixes. The responsive prefix always comes first.

```html
<button
  class="
  bg(blue-500)
  hover:bg(red-500)
  md:hover:bg(green-500)
"
>
  Button
</button>
```

- On all screens, the button turns red on hover.
- On medium screens and up (`md:`), the button will turn green on hover instead.
