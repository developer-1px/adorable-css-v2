# AdorableCSS - Technical Messaging Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Value Proposition

### The One-Liner
**"Write CSS the way you think in Figma"**

### The Elevator Pitch
AdorableCSS is the first CSS framework that truly bridges the gap between design and code. It translates Figma's mental model directly into CSS utilities, making developers write code that looks and feels like their design tool.

## ðŸš€ Key Differentiators

### 1. **Figma-Native Syntax**
```
Traditional CSS:            AdorableCSS:
display: flex;        â†’     hbox()
flex-direction: column; â†’   vbox()
gap: 16px;           â†’     gap(16)
width: 100%;         â†’     w(fill)
width: fit-content;  â†’     w(hug)
```

### 2. **Constraint-Based Layout**
- **Problem**: CSS doesn't have Figma's constraint system
- **Solution**: `layer()` utility that mimics Figma constraints
```html
<!-- Just like Figma constraints -->
<div class="layer(top:20/left:30)">
<div class="layer(center)">
<div class="layer(fill)">
```

### 3. **Perceptually Uniform Colors (OKLCH)**
- **Problem**: RGB/HSL gradients look muddy
- **Solution**: OKLCH color space for perfect gradients
```html
<!-- Always beautiful gradients -->
<div class="bg(purple-400..pink-400/135deg)">
```

- Function composition: `hbox(middle+between)`

### 3. **Performance First**
