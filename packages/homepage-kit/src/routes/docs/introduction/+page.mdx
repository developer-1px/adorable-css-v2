# Introduction to AdorableCSS

Welcome to AdorableCSS v2 - a Figma-first CSS framework that bridges the gap between design and development.

## What is AdorableCSS?

AdorableCSS is a modern CSS framework that uses **native CSS values** and **Figma-inspired naming conventions** to create a seamless workflow between designers and developers.

### Key Features

- **Figma-first Mental Model**: Uses familiar concepts like `hbox()`, `vbox()`, `w(fill)`, `w(hug)` that map directly to Figma's Auto Layout
- **Native CSS Values**: Write `scale(1.05)`, `opacity(0.5)` - exactly as CSS specifications define them
- **Built-in Design System**: Comprehensive color palette, typography scale, and spacing tokens
- **Smart Container System**: Intuitive `size(64)` syntax creates centered containers with optimized image handling
- **Component Library**: Pre-built components using string composition patterns

## Why AdorableCSS?

### For Designers
- Speak the same language as Figma
- See your designs translated perfectly to code
- No need to learn complex CSS conventions

### For Developers
- Write less CSS, achieve more
- Maintain consistency with design tokens
- Enjoy intelligent auto-completion and type safety

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install adorable-css
```

Then in your HTML:

```html
<div class="hbox(middle) gap(4) p(6) bg(white) r(xl) shadow(md)">
  <div class="size(64) r(full) bg(purple-500)"></div>
  <div class="vbox gap(2)">
    <h3 class="font(lg) bold c(gray-900)">Hello World</h3>
    <p class="text(sm) c(gray-600)">Welcome to AdorableCSS</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Core Concepts

### Layout with Figma Auto Layout

AdorableCSS makes layout intuitive with Figma-inspired utilities:

- `hbox()` - Horizontal flex container (row direction)
- `vbox()` - Vertical flex container (column direction)
- `gap()` - Spacing between items
- `p()` - Padding (inside spacing)

### Colors with Opacity

Use the dot notation for opacity:
- `c(white.5)` - 50% opacity white
- `bg(black.1)` - 10% opacity black background
- `border(gray-200.5)` - 50% opacity gray border

### Responsive Design

Every utility supports responsive prefixes:
- `md:w(full)` - Full width on medium screens
- `lg:grid(3)` - 3-column grid on large screens
- `xl:hidden` - Hidden on extra large screens
