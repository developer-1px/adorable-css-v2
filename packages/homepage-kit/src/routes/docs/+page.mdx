# AdorableCSS Documentation

Welcome to AdorableCSS v2 - the Figma-first CSS framework that brings design system thinking to web development.

## What is AdorableCSS?

AdorableCSS v2 is a revolutionary CSS framework that maps directly to Figma's mental model. Instead of fighting against design tools, we embrace them and create a seamless bridge between design and development.

### Key Features

- **Figma-native syntax**: `hbox()`, `vbox()`, `w(fill)`, `w(hug)` map directly to Figma concepts
- **Function-based approach**: `bg(purple-500)`, `c(gray-900)`, `p(16)` for clarity and consistency
- **Built-in design system**: Comprehensive color, typography, and spacing tokens
- **OKLCH color science**: Perceptually uniform colors with advanced theme support

### Quick Example

```html
<!-- Figma Auto Layout â†’ AdorableCSS -->
<div class="vbox gap(md) p(lg)">
  <h1 class="font(2xl) bold c(gray-900)">Welcome</h1>
  <p class="font(md/1.6) c(gray-600)">Get started with AdorableCSS</p>
  <button class="btn(primary)">Get Started</button>
</div>
```

## Core Philosophy

AdorableCSS v2 follows these principles:

1. **Design-first thinking**: Match Figma's properties panel structure
2. **Function syntax**: Clear, intentional `property(value)` format
3. **No margins**: Follow Figma's spacing model with padding and gap only
4. **Scientific colors**: OKLCH-based color system for consistent perception
